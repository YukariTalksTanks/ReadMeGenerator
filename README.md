I know it isnt professional to say this but ill change it when I update and get a regrade.

I've been having to deal with a bunch of shit this week

apart from the possibilty of getting kicked out of the house im renting (with roommates) and all the stress that intails along with all the missed sleep from stress and playing damage control; the stuff we blast through in a week. I just have not had the time to even go back and look at what we are doing let alone have the energy to even keep my eyes open in class.

So this is what I've got. I dont know where to start or what to do.
